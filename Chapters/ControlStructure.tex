This section is concerned with the control structure of the Water network


\subsection{Choice of state variables}

\subsection{Choice of inputs and output variables}

\subsection{Cascaded control}

\subsection{Influence of pump delay}
The pumps of the WDN system introduces a delay of approximately 5 seconds. According to \cite{Skogestad2005}, 
a time delay $\theta$ limits the possible bandwidth of a system to be 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:BWdelay}
	\omega_c < \frac{1}{\theta}
\end{equation}
