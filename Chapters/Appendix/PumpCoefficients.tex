\subsection{PumpCoefficients}

A model of the pump is based on the following relationship between the pressure drop over the pump and the pump speed, flow through the pump and the pump coefficients.

The full pump model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pumpmodel}
		\Delta p_{pump}  = a_0  \cdot \omega^2 + a_1 \cdot q \cdot \omega + a_2 \cdot q^2
\end{equation}

The pump coefficients are estimated from the pump performance curves from the data-sheets. These describe the exact relationship described in \cref{eq:pumpmodel}.

The preassure drops were read at the following flows:

\begin{equation}
	q = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0.5 & 1 & 1.5 & 2 & 2.5 & 3 & 3.5 
	\end{bmatrix} 
\label{eq:pump_q}
\end{equation}

At these flow speeds the pressure drop across the pump were read from the y-axis at three different pump speeds, namely 80\%, 69\% and 48\%. The recorded preassure drops were the following:

\begin{equation}
	p =  \begin{bmatrix}
		p_{80}\\
		p_{69} \\
		p_{48}
	\end{bmatrix}  = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		5.57 & 5.85 & 5.9 & 5.7 & 5.1 & 4.253.3 & 3.3 & 2.4 \\
		4.1 & 4.2 & 4.2 & 4 & 3.55 & 3 & 2.3 & 1.55 \\
		1.75 & 1.85 & 1.7 & 1.3 & 0.95 &  &  &  
	\end{bmatrix} 
\label{eq:pump_p}
\end{equation}

Only 5 pressure readings were made from the 48\% pump speed.

The coefficients are found by the least square solution to:

\begin{equation}
	Ax = b
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
	A = \begin{bmatrix}
			\omega^2 & q \cdot \omega & q^2
			\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and b = p.

The solution yields the following coefficients:
\begin{itemize}
	\item test
	\item test 2
\end{itemize}









\section{Legend for model}

Model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:NonLinearModelWithTank}
	\Phi\mathcal{J}\Phi^T \dot{q} = -\Phi\Big(\lambda(q_n)+\mu(q_n,OD)+\alpha(q_n,\omega)\Big) + \Psi(\bar{h}-\mathbf{1}h_0) + \mathcal{I}(p_{\tau}-\mathbf{1}p_0)
\end{equation}

where $p_{\tau}$ evolves according to:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:TankDynamics}
	\dot{p}_{\tau} = - \mathcal{T} \dot{d}_{\tau}, \ \mathcal{T} = diag(\tau_i)
\end{equation}

and the matrices $\Phi, \Psi, \mathcal{I}$ are defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:NonLinearModelMatrices}
	\Phi \triangleq 
	\begin{bmatrix} 
		I & -\bar{H}_C^T\bar{H}_T^{-T} \\ 0 & \bar{F}^T\bar{H}_T^{-T} \\ 0  & \bar{G}^T\bar{H}_T^{-T} \\ 
	\end{bmatrix}
	, \qquad
	\Psi \triangleq
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\ \bar{F}^T \\ \bar{G}^T
	\end{bmatrix}
	, \qquad
	\mathcal{I} \triangleq
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\ 0 \\ I
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

$\mu(q,OD)$: is the pressure drop across a valve

$\alpha(q,\omega)$: Pressure drop across the pump ($\Delta p_p$)
