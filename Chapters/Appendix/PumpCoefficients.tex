\subsection{PumpCoefficients}

A model of the pump is based on the following relationship between the pressure drop over the pump and the pump speed, flow through the pump and the pump coefficients.

The full pump model:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:pumpmodel}
		\Delta p_{pump}  = a_0  \cdot \omega^2 + a_1 \cdot q \cdot \omega + a_2 \cdot q^2
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l p{8cm} l}
		$a_{0-2}$ & are constants obtained from measurements of the pump
		$\Delta p$ & is the pressure drop over the pump
		$\omega ^2$ & is the angular velocity of the pump
		q & is the flow through the pump
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The pump coefficients are estimated from the pump performance curves from the data-sheets. These describe the exact relationship described in \cref{eq:pumpmodel}.
